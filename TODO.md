# TODO

- Play with streams-sandbox to get a basic understanding of streams and RxJS API
- See if we can get rid of Input/Output by turning them into adpater/plug concepts as well. Keep it simple!!
- Use streams, emit events, subscribe, subscriptions, observables correctly
- For `ComponentStream` ensure it can only be connected to an `AppService` (backbone)
- Use [Marble testing](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/testing-reactive-code/)
